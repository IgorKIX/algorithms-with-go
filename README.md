# algorithms-with-go

## Summary
So the time has come to refresh the knowledge of algorithms. I thought that I'll have much more fun from it when I'll combaine it with learing of golang. This is based on the [course from Princeton university](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).

## Folders:

### union-find
We have given consecutive numbers. With the help of the algorithm, we want to be able to combine them into groups and then check whether the two numbers belong to the connected groups (whether we can get from the first number to the second through the connections).

## Backstory

I've met this topic before during my studies, but it haven't spend enough time to get deep into. I focused more on the survival than on learning useful knowledge from this subject. In search of good challenges for golang training, I came up with the idea to remind, or rather really get to know, this field of computer science. 

Because the course is conducted in Java, and I don't have full fluency in using Go, my implementations will not be the best possible, but my main goal in this topic is to learn the techniques used to solve programming problems and to feel more confident in writing code in Go.

I'll try to make some notes with the discription of the algorithms in the sub folders.

If I do not lose my self-denial, I will try to create some simple program for imaging how the algorithms works.
